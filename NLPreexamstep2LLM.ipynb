         " – 1991-ųjų metų Sausio 13-oji iš esmės buvo paskutinis iš Baltijos šalims užsitęsusio Antrojo pasaulinio karo mūšių. Pavėluotas, nes jau buvo praėję beveik penkiasdešimt metų nuo Ribentropo-Molotovo pakto, tačiau laimėtas.  Ačiū, Pone prezidente, kad jūs šiandien įsisegėte neužmirštuolę, kurią ir daugelis mano kolegų įsisegė. Šiandien Sausio 13-ąją minime jau ne tik kaip tragiškų netekčių dieną, nors po tankų vikšrais tada žuvo arba buvo sužeisti laisvę ginusieji žmonės. Šiandien mums tai – pergalės diena, nutiesusi kelią į Europos Sąjungą ir NATO. Galutinai Antrasis pasaulinis karas mums baigėsi dar po dvejų metų – devyniasdešimt trečių rugsėjo pirmą, kai iš Lietuvos buvo išvesta SSRS kariuomenė. Ši neužmirštuolė Jūsų atlapuose yra pagarbos ir atminimo ženklas visoms sovietinio komunizmo aukoms: nuo Baltijos, Lenkijos iki Rumunijos, Bulgarijos, Albanijos, o taip pat ir milijonams nužudytųjų pačioje Rusijoje. Šiandien man gera proga padėkoti visiems kolegoms, kurie balsavote už svarbią rezoliuciją dėl Rusijos Federacijos veiksmų prieš Sausio 13-osios bylos tyrėjus ir teisėjus lapkritį. Jūsų išreikštas solidarumas yra labai svarbi europietiška vertybė.",
         " January 13, 1991 was essentially the last of the Battle of the Second World War. It was delayed because it had been almost fifty years since the Ribentropo-Molotov Pact, but won.  Thank you, Mr. President, that you entered the unforgettable, which many of my colleagues have entered today. Today, January 13 is not just the day of tragic losses, although after the tanks, the defenders were killed or wounded. Today is a day of victory for us, setting the way to the European Union and NATO. Finally, the Second World War ended two years later – the first of the ninety-third of September, when the Soviet army was taken out of Lithuania. This memorandum is a sign of respect and remembrance to all the victims of Soviet communism: from the Baltics, Poland to Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and also to millions of killed in Russia itself. Today I am a good opportunity to thank all the colleagues who voted for an important resolution on the actions of the Russian Federation against the investigators and judges of the January 13 case in November. Your solidarity is an important European value.",

       "[' January 13, 1991 was essentially the last of the Battle of the Second World War. It was delayed because it had been almost fifty years since the Ribentropo-Molotov Pact, but won.  Thank you, Mr. President, that you entered the unforgettable, which many of my colleagues have entered today. Today, January 13 is not just the day of tragic losses, although after the tanks, the defenders were killed or wounded. Today is a day of victory for us, setting the way to the European Union and NATO. Finally, the Second World War ended two years later – the first of the ninety-third of September, when the Soviet army was taken out of Lithuania. This memorandum is a sign of respect and remembrance to all the victims of Soviet communism: from the Baltics, Poland to Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and also to millions of killed in Russia itself. Today I am a good opportunity to thank all the colleagues who voted for an important resolution on the actions of the Russian Federation against the investigators and judges of the January 13 case in November. Your solidarity is an important European value.',\n",
       " 'on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr\\xa0President, Sweden has serious problems with violence connected to organised crime, and the city of Malmö is particularly affected. Bombings and shootings are now part of everyday life in Malmö. Last year, the Danish Government introduced border controls against Sweden to protect Danish citizens from Swedish gang members. This is a unique decision. No other government in Europe has so clearly pointed out gang members in a neighbouring country as the reason to have border controls. The PPE believes that the escalating violence in Malmö and Copenhagen should be mentioned in the title of the debate on cross-border crime, and we ask for a roll call vote on this matter. The fact that the S&D Group doesn’t want the problems in Malmö to be mentioned in the title is deeply regrettable. Let’s take the chance in this Parliament and change this today. We have serious problems to handle and it’s important for Sweden, Denmark and Europe. (Applause)',\n",
       " ' “Mr. President, what seems regrettable to me is that we try to use this turn, which enables to modify the order of the day, to, for the third time in a row, try to win a vote that has already been lost in two occasions. And I say this because the Group of the European People’s Party has attempted twice to transfer this issue to the Conference of Presidents and the other groups have clearly told us what our position is. If necessary, we will repeat it again. We believe it is important to talk about the dangers of organized crime, but without the need to criminalize a specific issue and attack a specific city, in this case. So continue to insist. This political group will continue to hold the same position. ',\n",
       " 'on behalf of the ID group. “Mr. President, my dear colleagues, in the face of the nightmare news of a kissing continent, where thousands of animals, insects and plants have gone into smoke in a few weeks and where human lives are seriously threatened, we have the collective duty to react. This reaction can find its foundation in the European culture of solidarity, which is more with this great friend country that is Australia. The architecture and the modalities of the rescEU program, although it is theoretically reserved for the Member States, allow it. It is the idea of sending exceptional logistical and operational capabilities to this continent to fight flames. Also, please support, dear colleagues, this title amendment for our declaration to the Commission on these devastating fires in Australia.',\n",
       " ' – Mr\\xa0President, unfortunately the nightmare that is happening in Australia does not happen by itself, it happens because of climate change. Therefore, we disagree with removing the title. However, we do believe that we have a moral responsibility to use rescEU all over the world in all possible means. So we would not object to the rescEU part being a part of the title, but we would object to removing the reference to climate change from the title.',\n",
       " 'on behalf of the GUE/NGL group. The European Parliament voted a resolution against police violence in the European Union. We see today, everywhere in Europe, protesters who are mismanaged and violated by the police, and I think especially of Greek, Belgian, Romanian, Polish, French and so many others. Despite the condemnations by the UN, NGOs, Amnesty International, the European Court of Human Rights or the Human Rights Defender, I would like to remind you of a picture that we have seen this week: a young girl who is raped and bullied by the law enforcement forces or even the end-to-end shootings of defensive bullets (LBDs). Our GUE group and the delegation France insoumise therefore call for a debate and a resolution on the prohibition of LBDs, de-circle grenades and wind plaque, which are prohibited in some countries. The use of force, I remind, must be proportionate and therefore, my dear colleagues, as we are going to talk about text on fundamental freedoms this week, I remind you that the right to demonstrate is a fundamental freedom that the European Union must guarantee.',\n",
       " ' Mr President! My way! I want to say that you used the name of my country: Poland. In Poland, the demonstrations take place peacefully and are not suppressed by the police, but protected. However, if it comes to the issue of the rule of law in France, we agree, but we have our own proposal and I hope that Mr. President will allow me to submit it on behalf of the ECR group at the right time. This is also a matter of changing the agenda on Wednesday.',\n",
       " ' Is it possible to ask for a separate vote? Because the proposal, as we understand, is a debate with resolution. We would be ready to make the debate, but not that there would be a resolution. So, if possible, we ask to separate the vote, and we would support the debate.',\n",
       " 'on behalf of the ECR Group. Mr President! In connection with the use of force against defensive lawyers and lawyers in the court building in Paris and the previous brutal pacifications of the protesters, so-called yellow camisels, on behalf of the ECR group, I propose a debate with the adoption of a resolution on the state of rule of law in France. I remind you that the right to manifest and to express their opinions is the foundation of the European Union, specially stipulated in Article 12 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which guarantees to everyone the right to free and peaceful assembly. The authorities in France, using force against their own citizens and lawyers, violate the above principles, which are also revoked by the Treaty on the European Union and the Lisbon Treaty. So let’s look at whether the same rules and the same law are applied to large EU countries, such as France, as to smaller countries, where – I remind – the protests are not suppressed. Is the principle of equality respected? I ask for a nominal vote so that everyone can speak openly about whether he supports physical attacks on undefenced lawyers in France.',\n",
       " 'on behalf of the PPE group. Mrs President! Dear Commissioner Šefčovič, thank you very much for your report. Let me make two comments on this: First, on the occasion of the Commission’s re-start, on the occasion of the Green Deal and on the occasion of the World Climate Conference in Madrid, the EU must complement its foreign policy more clearly than before with the climate and environmental dimension. We need not only summit and conference diplomacy, we need a constant advertising on compliance with the Paris climate targets and the contents of the Green Deal. The future EU climate diplomacy needs to be personally strengthened and clearly attributed, above all, institutional and competent, so that we can quickly get to the boat so far difficult partners such as Australia in the future. And, on the other hand, we have to keep in mind that the way fire is being combated has been questioned. The Australian fire control system is one of the best in the world and has yet been overwhelmed by the new fire dynamics. We have to deal with it to live with the fire. to leave certain areas uninhabited in the future. In 2018, 100 people were killed in forest fires in Greece. The Australian vegetation is found in many parts of the world, and here in Europe a new hot summer can come. For this reason, dear representatives of the Council and the Commission: Please address both the new challenge in the prevention and adaptation of firestorms and the strengthening of the European climate diplomacy.',\n",
       " 'on behalf of the S&D Group. – Madam\\xa0President, many might think that what is happening in Australia is happening in a faraway continent with no impact here in Europe, but nothing can be further from the truth. The wildfires in Australia are increasing the CO2 levels in our atmosphere and creating toxic airspaces. The smoke created by these wildfires is orbiting the entire planet. Fires in New South Wales and Queensland alone emitted a combined 306\\xa0million tonnes of carbon dioxide and they are generating enough heat to create unique weather systems, including cyclonic fire tornados.  The 7.3 million hectares of land that have been destroyed cover an area that exceeds the size of the Netherlands and Belgium combined. Over one billion animals – twice the amount of EU citizens – have perished. And this is, yes, a biodiversity crisis. Australia is home to truly unique species, including 200 types of mammals that do not exist anywhere else in the world.  In the face of this destruction, complacency should have no place, and the EU needs to remain a leader in fighting climate change when these things happen. Because we saw an unperturbed government in Brazil when the Amazon was on fire, and we are seeing an Australian Government that for the past months has been hesitating to link these fires to climate change. We saw some Members of this House today trying to do the same. It is even planning to use a carbon accounting loophole to fulfil its Paris Agreement commitments and this is not acceptable. As we discuss here, the Australian wildfires are still raging, and are projected to do so for at least another month. Ultimately we are speaking about climate change. We are in this together. That’s why we urge the Australian Government to recognise climate change, phase out its dependency on the fossil fuel industry, and honour the Paris Agreement now, before it’s too late.',\n",
       " 'In the name of the Renew Group. Mrs President! In the name of the Delegation for Relations with Australia and New Zealand, I would like to express our sincere condolences to the victims of the Australian buses. We are in this extremely difficult time facing the serious losses of human lives, the losses of private property, livestock, wildlife and nature, and the damage to the economy in full solidarity with the Australian people. Our thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims and injured, and our heartfelt thanks is also to the firefighters and the volunteer forces. Of course, the question is first about the causes of these catastrophic fires. The climate in Australia is generally hot and dry. Busfires are a permanent part of Australian ecology and allow, among other things, the re-growth of certain species and plants. However, it is not to mention that climate change also leads to dry and warmer summer in Australia and thus also affects the length of the burning season. What consequences will we take now? First, we have to examine whether the EU disaster protection mechanism has grown to this extent. This concerns both EU interventions and our ability to provide assistance in third countries in such emergencies. Of course, Australia also has to adhere to its climate targets, and I expect these targets to be achieved, even due to the great potential of renewable energies. Prime Minister Morrison has already stated this in the press. The delegation of the European Parliament is scheduled to travel to Australia in February, where it will be informed, among other things, of the effects of the fires and the progress in climate protection. We will conduct an open discussion with the members and the government. And now I want to say that we are primarily offering our support to our Australian friends in this difficult moment and standing on their side in dealing with the enormous challenges.',\n",
       " 'The Verts/ALE Group. The President! Australia is currently experiencing the most warm summer that the country has had – the start was also the dryest. The average temperature for the month of December was more than 4 degrees above the normal for that country – completely extreme 1.7 degrees above the previous record in December, and this old record was for the rest so late as last year.  This is exactly what climate scientists have warned for: a warmer climate, of course, leads to an increased risk of heat waves, but also an increased risk of drying, and thus also an increased risk of forest fires. With the completely insufficient climate policy we are currently pursuing in the EU, the US, China and just Australia, we are on the way towards a 3- to 4-degree warming at the end of the century. And this summer will then be considered a normal summer.  Is this what we want to contribute from Europe? We have to do a lot, a lot more – now. Not in 2030. Not in 2050, but now, this year. ',\n",
       " 'on behalf of the ID group. Mrs President! What most disturbs me in the discussion is the sensational jelly satisfaction of the left-green climate neuros over the terrible fires in Australia: here is finally the proof of human-made climate change. Shame yourself, please strongly. Without wanting to sound cynical: Increasing fire burns emerged from the fires that belong to the continent’s ecosystem: 1851, 1939, 1983, 1974, 1975 for example, were such years. What about dryness? In fact, there is a tendency to a higher annual rainfall amount, as can be seen here in this descriptive statistics of the last 120 years, even though 2019 was low rainfall. The reasons for the fires? Among other things, in addition to the fire foundation, it was the curious policy of the green environmental protectors, which prevented the state programs for targeted burning of dead wood. This has massively increased the so-called burning load. Even small burning fires can develop disastrously. By the way, these facts make the suffering of those affected unbearable, as well as the drama in the animal world.',\n",
       " 'on behalf of the ECR Group. Mrs President! Dear state! The situation in Australia is very serious. The fires burn almost the entire continent. For many weeks, massive destruction has been associated with harm to the Australian nature and biodiversity, threatening the lives of humans and animals. Of course, we are all deeply concerned about the development of the situation, keeping so long dry and high temperatures that, of course, favour these fires.  But let’s not forget that the fire on the Australian continent is not a new phenomenon. They happen almost annually. What is surprising when I listen to our discussion is that concern of the European Parliament about climate change. For if we look at the European Parliament’s actions, how does it take care of the climate, as one time a month it moves into Strasbourg for four days, generating CO2 and an annual cost of 110 billion euros? I am calling for actions, not words. ',\n",
       " 'on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. – Madam\\xa0President, (I would like to say to Vice-President Šefčovič that) the fires in Australia are unprecedented, yes, but they’re not unexpected. In 2008, the Garnaut report on climate change commissioned by the Australian Government projected that fire seasons would be longer, fires would be more intense and their effect would increase over time, becoming fully observable in 2020. Our own science from the GRC of 2018 says exactly the same: longer seasons, larger areas, bigger fires. Especially in the south of Europe, even in the best case scenario of a 2 degree warming, the projections for the future are near apocalyptic.  What did the current neoliberal climate-denying Australian Government do besides blocking agreement in COP25? They reduced the budget of New South Wales for firefighting by 75% and that for rescue by 34%. Mr Vice-President, we must not do like the Australians. We must do as our own scientists and our own children demand. We must invest and innovate in fire adaptation and civic rotation and we must make our rescEU and EFIS capabilities a global leader as part of the external Green New Deal. (Applause)',\n",
       " ' “Mr. President, dear colleagues, the fires that have devastated Australia since September bring a dramatic budget, we’ve talked about it and we’re seeing it: twenty-five people have died, more than 10 million hectares of land have been destroyed, more than one billion animals have been killed. The capital Canberra, with its 500,000 inhabitants, recorded the worst air quality in the world and smoke reached even Chile and Argentina. It is an unacceptable budget and it is the last tax that adds to the growing list of extreme weather events that are caused by climate change. However, the dramatic images of the fires are not enough for the Australian Prime Minister, who not only reacted late to the fires but also stated that his conservative government will not strengthen policies to fight climate change. Australia was also one of the countries, along with Brazil, which most obstructed the negotiations in Madrid in the last COP 25. The Commission is currently negotiating a free trade agreement with Australia. How do you act to ensure that sustainability objectives and environmental standards are included in the Sustainable Development Chapter? Do you intend to support these goals through sanctions in case of non-compliance?',\n",
       " 'The problem in Australia is not the fire itself, it is a part of the Australian nature for a long time. Butterfly, forests and Australian unique species are adapted to it. The problem is the large-scale range of fires allowed in two extremely warm and dry years. The average summer temperature was four degrees higher than normal. I would like to say, “Welcome to the future.” In the near future, this scenario will be common, fires will repeat, their scope, intensity and frequency will increase. If we do not start effectively reducing carbon emissions and do not allow nature to adapt to changing conditions to a maximum extent, Australia will be a terrible example of the failure of an economic model incompatible with life on our planet. The reform must be a global initiative that is consistently transformed into national policies. Let’s not be subject to the illusion that it doesn’t affect us, that Australia is too distant and exotic. This smallest continent in that, unfortunately, won’t stay alone.',\n",
       " ' – Madam\\xa0President, massive wildfires have been raging through the country in recent months. Since last September, 28 people have died and thousands have lost their homes. Firefighters are risking their own lives to keep people safe. Our sympathy is with the Australian people in these difficult times. Not rain, but ash is falling from the skies of Australia. We all know that these extreme bush fires cannot be viewed separately from climate change. This is not a casual emergency – this is a climate emergency, stemming from a climate crisis. Now the question is whether these catastrophic fires will bring some sanity to Australian climate politics. The Conservative government, led by Prime Minister Morrison, has done nothing to meet its climate commitments. During the UN climate talks in Madrid, ‘ScoMo’ sided with Brazil and Saudi Arabia to derail global action on cutting emissions. How can a Prime Minister make fear of the costs of climate action more terrifying than the actual results of climate change themselves? Of course, this is not only an Australian problem. It is related to one of the biggest global challenges of our time, in which we all bear responsibility. The devastating Australian fires underline the magnitude of the effects of inaction at the recent COP 25 Climate Conference. This only makes it more important for us, as the EU, to lead and set a standard for the rest of the world. But the European Green Deal is not and cannot be only about Europe – climate diplomacy must become an integral part of our external policy and a fundamental pillar of our soft power around the globe. There is no time to waste anymore. Leading by example we must bring all of our partners with us for common, bold political action on the climate crisis.',\n",
       " ' “Mr President, do you hear this scream, even 17,000 kilometers from Australia? Do we hear the pain of the families of human victims and the suffering of the victims who have completely lost everything? Do we hear the screams of a billion carbonized animals? It’s a shocking cry, it’s a shocking SOS that sounds like a planetary alarm cry and it’s exactly in this way that we must hear the Australian drama that, despite it, makes the demonstration that we are right to build a European Green Pact. You know, 300,000 European citizens live two hours from Sydney, New Caledonia: they are – and we are, therefore – the first neighbors and the first witnesses of the disaster. Today, in Europe, we must mobilize in the name of solidarity, of course, but the reality is that we need an obligation of collective intelligence and a political mobilization. While we have just declared the climate emergency, how not to understand that if we do not accelerate our fight against climate disorder, the Australian disaster will be our planetary drama tomorrow. How not to understand that we must fight climate skeptics all over the world, including here, because the consequences of ecological dramas have no boundaries: from Australia to Chile, a toxic cloud has just crossed the world’s largest ocean, a ocean rich in biodiversity. I want to remind that 80% of European biodiversity comes from overseas: with this legitimacy I reaffirm the need for concrete actions to protect the environment and future generations and with this assumed optimism I declare that the European Green Pact must rely on overseas which are solutions territories.']"
